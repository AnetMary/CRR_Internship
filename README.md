Smartphone Retail Outlet Sale Analysis.
### **Project Introduction: Smartphone Retail Outlet Sales Analysis**  
This project analyzes sales data from a smartphone retail outlet to uncover actionable insights into product performance, payment methods, and sales trends. Key variables include Date(2018-2022), Fiscal Year (F.Y.), Quarter, Product Type (Mobile, Accessory, Tablet), Quantity, Price, Amount, and Payment Type.

### **Overall Sales Analysis**  
Mobile phones dominate sales, reflecting their high demand, while accessories and tablets remain secondary. A notable sales spike in Q2 of 2021-2022 suggests seasonal or market-driven influences, followed by a sharp decline that requires investigation to address potential challenges.

### **Product Performance**  
Budget phones lead in quantity sold, while mobiles are the primary revenue generators. Accessories contribute significantly to sales volume but less to revenue, whereas tablets show minimal impact, indicating the need for strategic repositioning or promotions.

### **Payment Method Analysis**  
Digital payments (Debit, Mobile, and Credit) account for nearly 90% of sales, highlighting a strong shift towards cashless transactions. Cash payments remain minimal, reflecting customer preference for convenience and modern payment methods.

### **Price and Quantity Insights**  
The pricing strategy aligns well with product types: mobiles as premium, tablets as mid-range, and accessories as affordable. Accessories drive high volumes but low revenue, while mobiles contribute heavily to revenue. Tablets may benefit from targeted promotions to improve both sales volume and revenue.
